### Disclaimer ###

The solutions in this repo are written by a Python noob (me) and the only goal
of these scripts is to find the solution for the AoC challenges.
If you want to find cool tricks or super optimized algorithms, look elsewhere.
These solutions are mostly about pure brute forcing! ðŸ’ª
